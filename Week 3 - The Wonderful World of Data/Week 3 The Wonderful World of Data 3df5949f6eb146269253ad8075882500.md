## Follow the Data Life Cycle

### Data Analysis Phases

**Act**: Define the problem and confirm stakeholder expectations

**Prepare**: Collect and store data for analysis

**Process**: Clean and transform data to ensure integrity

**Analyze**: Use data analysis tools to draw conclusions.

**Share**: Interpret and communicate results to others to make data-driven decisions.

**Act**: Put your insights to work in order to solve the original problems

### [Stages of the Data Life Cycle](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/DoiXy/variations-of-the-data-life-cycle)

**Planning ‚Üí Capturing ‚Üí Managing ‚Üí Analyzing ‚Üí Archiving ‚Üí Destroying**

- **Database**: A collection of data stored in a computer system

### Self-Reflection: Collecting Data

- ****************Scenario****************
    
    Imagine that you interview for a data analyst role at a local ice cream company. The hiring manager explains that the company needs a data analyst because they want to learn more about their customers. First, they want to understand their customers‚Äô ice cream flavor preferences. Then, they will use this customer data to help make important decisions.
    
    The hiring manager explains that they do not collect any customer data, and they don‚Äôt know where to begin. The hiring manager asks you: Can you please explain how you would approach this task?
    
    Before responding to the question, you consider each step of the data life cycle.
    
- ********Recap: The steps of the data life cycle:********
    - **Plan**: What plans and decisions do you need to make? What data do you need to answer your question?
    - **Capture**: Where does your data come from? How will you get it?
    - **Manage**: How will you store your data? What should it be used for? How do you keep this data secure and protected?
    - **Analyze**: How will the company analyze the data? What tools should they use?
    - **Archive**: What should they do with their data when it gets old? How do they know when it‚Äôs time?
    - **Destroy**: Should they ever dispose of any data? If so, when and how?
- Reflection
    
    To use their data successfully - the ice cream company must:
    
    1. Figure out what data they need and where they can get it.
    2. Collect the data, and be sure of what they will (and won‚Äôt) use it for.
    3. Consider how to secure the data and deal with old data that is no longer useful.
    
    <aside>
    üí° As a data analyst, these are types of questions you should always seek to answer about your data. From considering data collection before a project begins (in the plan phase) to removing data with data erasure software (in the destroy phase), data analysts must apply these concepts to effectively approach each data project.

### Test Your Knowledge on the Data Life Cycle

1. During the planning phase of the data life cycle, a business decides which kind of data it needs, how it will be managed, who will be responsible for it, and the optimal outcomes.
2. In the data life cycle, the capture phase involves gathering data from various sources and bringing it into the organization.
3. A data analyst finishes using a dataset, so they erase or shared the files in order to protect private information. This is called destroying.
4. A dairy farmer decides to open an ice cream shop on her farm. After surveying the local community about people‚Äôs favorite flavors, she takes the data they provided and stores it in a secure hard drive so it can be maintained safely on her computer. This is part of which phase of the data life cycle?
    
    ‚Üí This is the manage phase of the data life cycle. It deals with how data is cared for, how and where it‚Äôs stored, the tools used to keep it safe and secure, and the actions taken to make sure it‚Äôs maintained properly.
    
5. After opening the ice cream shop on her farm, the same dairy farmer then surveys the local community about people‚Äôs favorite flavors. She uses the data she collected to determine that the top five flavors are strawberry, vanilla, chocolate, mint chip, and peanut butter. She feels confident in her decision to sell these flavors. This is part of which phase of the data life cycle?
    
    ‚Üí This is part of the analyze phase. This phase involves using data to make smart decisions and support business goals.

## Outlining the Data Analysis Process

### Six Phases of Data Analysis

1. **Ask**
- Stakeholders: People who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome
    
    ‚Üí Look at the current state and identify how it‚Äôs different from the ideal state
    
- Determine who the stakeholders are
1. **Prepare**
2. **Process**
3. **Analyze**
4. **Share**
5. **Act**

### Test Your Knowledge on the Data Analysis Process

1. During the ask phase, data analysts define the problem by looking at the current state and identifying how it‚Äôs different from the ideal state.
2. During the process phase, a data analyst cleans data to ensure it‚Äôs complete and correct.
    
    The process phase is all about getting the details right, so data analysts clean data by fixing typos, inconsistencies, and missing or inaccurate data.
    
3. The analyze phase involves using data analytics tools such as spreadsheets and query languages to transform data in order to draw conclusions and make informed decisions.
4. The share phase involves how results are interpreted and shared with others, often through data visualization.
5. A data analyst shares insights from their analysis during a formal presentation to stakeholders. In a slideshow, they make a data-driven recommendation for how to solve a business problem. What phase of the data analysis process would come next?
    
    ‚Üí In this scenario, the data analyst has just shared insights. So, the next phase would be to act and put those insights to work in order to solve the business problem.

| Controlled by the user | Controlled by a database management system |

### Self-Reflection: Reviewing Past Concepts

Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data:

- What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?
- What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?
- My answer:
    
    The data life cycle and the data analysis process are quite similar but not at all. The similarity is that they all have 6 phases of their own. But each phase has a unique problem to deal with. Data life cycle deals with the stages that data goes through during its useful life while data analysis is the process of analyzing data. Or data life cycle deals with identifying data which is appropriate to solve a problem,...
    The similarities between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle are: they are the first phase of each process and very important. Second, they both require us to ask the right question and give the right tasks to each member. Otherwise, they have a big difference. While the Ask phase requires us a open mind to look at a ‚ÄúBig Picture‚Äù and create a plan for a whole project, the Plan phase of the data life cycle requires us to look at very small details, like decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and even who will be responsible for it.

<aside>
üí° While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you‚Äôre going to get it.
