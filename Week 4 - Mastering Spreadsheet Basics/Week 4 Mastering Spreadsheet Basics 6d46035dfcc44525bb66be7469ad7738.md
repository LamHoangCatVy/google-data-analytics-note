## Mastering Spreadsheet Basics

### Columns and Rows and Cells, Oh My!

- Attribute: A characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table
- Observation: All of the attributes for something contained in a row of a data table
- Formula: A set of instructions that performs a specific action using the data in a spreadsheet

### Hands-On Activity: Generating a Chart from a Spreadsheet

1. After you added data to the spreadsheet, you cleaned up the chart. What step did you take to make the chart descriptive?
    
    → To make your chart descriptive, you used the Chart Editor’ menu and updated the chart title. Going forward, if you continue to collect data, you can use this spreadsheet to do so! The spreadsheet is a natural choice for storing your data, and practice with professional tools will help you develop your skills and continue to refine your data analyst’s toolkit.
    
2. Response to each of the following questions.
    - How did you use a spreadsheet to help prepare your data?
    
    → A spreadsheet helps you structure data in rows and columns, prepare data for analysis, and create custom data visualizations. 
    
    - How did you format your chart to help you analyze your data?
    
    → To better analyze your data, you clean up your chart to make it more visually appealing and to clarify what data means by making your chart more descriptive. To do that, it’s important to add chart titles and axis titles. Ultimately, this is an essential skill to master because clear, descriptive data visualizations help data analysts be great storytellers.
    

### Test Your Knowledge on Spreadsheet Basics

1. In a spreadsheet, text wrapping is used to allow all of the text to fit inside a cell
2. In s spreadsheet, columns are ordered by letter and rows are ordered by number.
3. In a data table, a row is called an observation. An observation includes all of the attributes for what is contained in the row. An attribute is a quality or characteristic of data.

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

### [SQL in Action](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/simon/sql-guide-getting-started)

- SQL:
    - Store
    - Organize
    - Analyze
- Query: A request for data or information from a database
- A data analyst uses a SQL query to retrieve information from a database. They add a WHERE statement to *********************filter********************* the data based on certain conditions.

1. The * tells the database to select all columns from the employee table. The criteria in the WHERE clause tells the database what data in those columns the query should return.
2. In this query, the data analyst wants to retrieve data from ***employee*** table.
3. This query will select all data from the employee table, where the `jobCode` is `FTE` and the `LastName` is `James`.

## Data Visualization

### Becoming a Data Viz Whiz

- Data analysts use data visualizations to explain complex data quickly, reinforce data analysis, and create interesting graphs and charts.

### [Planning a Data Visualization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data/supplement/xPmo7/planning-a-data-visualization)

Steps to plan a data visualization

- Step 1: Explore the data for patterns
- Step 2: Plan your visuals
- Step 3: Create your visuals

### Test Your Knowledge on Visualizing Data

1. A data visualization is the graphical representation of information.
2. A pie chart shows how a whole is broken down into parts and is an effective visualization for a class broken down by age.
3. Data visualizations can clearly demonstrate patterns and trends, help stakeholders understand complex data more quickly, and illustrate relationships between data points.

## Weekly Challenge 4

- Sorting a range of data from A to Z helps data analysts organize and find data more quickly.
- AVERAGE returns an average of values from a selected range.
- A data analyst creates a table, but they realize this isn’t the best visualization for their data. To fix the problem, they decide to use the chart editor feature to change it a column chart. The chart editor enables data analysts to choose the type of chart you’re making and customize its appearance.
