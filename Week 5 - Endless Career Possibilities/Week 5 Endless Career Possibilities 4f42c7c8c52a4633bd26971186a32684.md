ðŸ’¡ Consider a restaurant that delivers cold food to customers. More data about the delivery process, such as the average delivery time or the average number of daily deliveries, could help the restaurant streamline the process and deliver food on time.

Data analytics helps businesses make better decisions but getting there is a process. It begins with analyzing a business problem, identifying data about that problem, and then using data analysis to arrive at an answer. Sometimes you get an answer that solves your business problem, but itâ€™s often just as likely that you discover other questions to investigate further.

### Self-Reflection: Business Cases

### Case Study #1:

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good).

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success

- What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
- How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?
- My answer
    
    There are some misconceptions in this scenario. After raising a campaign and rating attendances, the executive team should sort out how much teachers were ranked by just 1 to 3 and how much teachers were ranked by 4 to 6 in both groups (join in and not join in the workshop). After that, we will have clearer rating
    

Googlerâ€™s answer

- This is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude - as the administration did - that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating.
- The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This groups of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective.
- Itâ€™s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.

### Case Study #2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadwaysâ€”specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions.

- What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
- How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?
- My answer
    
    There's a foolproof error. If the company want to test the self-driving car prototype, the most important part is sensor. In day-time, the data they collect worth one because it the basic condition they use to make that innovative car. The indispensable time they need to do the test is night time because there are different errors occur about color (it will get darker at night,...), weather condition (the sensor may get blurred,..)
    They need to perform the test in different time of day and different weather condition to make sure the sensor and other tech-things will facilitate normally
    

Googlerâ€™s answer

- This case study shows an unfair practice. While the researchers test the prototype on three different tracks, they only conduct tests during the day.
- Conditions on each track may be very different during the day and night and this could change the results significantly. The data analyst should correct this by asking the test team to add in nighttime testing to get a full perspective of how the prototype performs at any time of the day on the tracks.

### Case Study #3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitorsâ€™ interests, the park develops a survey.

They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

- What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
- How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?
- My answer
    
    I think this is a problem of customers' psychology. They distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the long lines, but it accidentally create a initial unconscious psychology in the customer mind. And they will think like :" Ahh, there're roller coasters here, but they're not enough to play, OK I will choose roller coaters" or just because in their mind, there's only an image of roller coasters. I thinks the same results will show out at the other places like: The Rotor, The Haunted Mansion.,...
    I think they should do the survey at the "Hello" gate or at some concession stand or at somewhere not make any impacts on customers' awareness. By that way I think the execute team of the amusement park can understand basically what the customers' needs
    

Googlerâ€™s answer

- This case study contains an unfair practice. While the decision to distribute surveys in places where visitors would have time to respond makes sense, it accidentally introduces sampling bias.
- The only respondents to the survey are people waiting in line for the roller coasters. This may unfairly bias survey results, because respondents might prefer roller coasters. A data analyst could reduce sampling bias by distributing the survey at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. This would avoid targeting roller coaster fans and provide results from the parkâ€™s general audience.

### Test Your Knowledge on Making Fair Business Decisions

1. Steps data analysts take to ensure fairness when collecting data
    
    â†’ Considering inclusive sample populations, social context, and self-reported data enable fairness in data collection.
    
2. Avens Engineering needs more engineers, so they purchase ads on a job search website. The websiteâ€™s data reveals that 86% of engineers are men. Based on that number, an analyst decides that men are more likely to be successful applicants, so they target the ads to male job seekers. What should the analyst have done instead?
    
    â†’ Make sure their recommendation doesnâ€™t create or reinforce bias. As a data analyst, itâ€™s important to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.
    
3. On a railway line, peak ridership occurs between 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM. The fairness of a passenger survey could be improved by over-sampling data from which group?
    
    â†’ Nighttime riders. Over-sampling the data from nighttime riders, and under-represented group of passengers, could improve the fairness of the survey. 
    
4. A real estate company needs to hire a human resources assistant. The owner asks a data analyst to help them decide where to advertise the job opening. The analyst learns that the majority of human resources professionals are women, validates this finding with research, and targets ads to a women's community college.
    
    â†’ This is NOT FAIR. Fairness means ensuring that analysis doesnâ€™t create or reinforce bias. As a data analyst, itâ€™s important to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.
